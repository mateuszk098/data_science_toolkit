## **What is this?** üìú

This repository contains different notebooks from [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/) competitions in which I have participated and am currently taking part in. You can find here different types of notebooks, starting from very simple datasets like Titanic one up to challenges related to NLP like machine translation with Transformer architectures or competitions with money prizes.

## **Contents** üïµ

- [**Digit Recognizer**](https://github.com/mateuszk098/kaggle_notebooks/tree/master/digit_recognizer) - _MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto ‚Äúhello world‚Äù dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.</br>
In this competition, your goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. We‚Äôve curated a set of tutorial-style kernels which cover everything from regression to neural networks. We encourage you to experiment with different algorithms to learn first-hand what works well and how techniques compare._</br>

- [**House Prices**](https://github.com/mateuszk098/kaggle_notebooks/tree/master/house_prices) - _Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.</br>
With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home._</br>

We will focus on employing the encoder-decoder RNN architecture and a disruptive approach to NLP, i.e. transformers architecture. To do that, we will use two English-French datasets. In the first part, we will focus on an easy dataset (around 180000 sentences, 12 MB), whereas in the second part, we will use the second dataset (about 22.5 million sentences, 8 GB). In this notebook, we translate English sentences into French ones. Therefore, we tackle the sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) learning problem._</br>

- [**Spaceship Titanic**](https://github.com/mateuszk098/kaggle_notebooks/tree/master/spaceship_titanic) - _Welcome to the year 2912, where your data science skills are needed to solve a cosmic mystery. We've received a transmission from four lightyears away and things aren't looking good. The Spaceship Titanic was an interstellar passenger liner launched a month ago. With almost 13,000 passengers on board, the vessel set out on its maiden voyage transporting emigrants from our solar system to three newly habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby stars. While rounding Alpha Centauri en route to its first destination - the torrid 55 Cancri E - the unwary Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly hidden within a dust cloud. Sadly, it met a similar fate as its namesake from 1000 years before. Though the ship stayed intact, almost half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension!</br>
In this competition your task is to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with the spacetime anomaly. To help you make these predictions, you're given a set of personal records recovered from the ship's damaged computer system._</br>

- [**Titanic**](https://github.com/mateuszk098/kaggle_notebooks/tree/master/titanic) - _The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered "unsinkable" RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren‚Äôt enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.</br>
In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: "what sorts of people were more likely to survive?" using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc)._</br>

- [**Tyre Quality Classification**](https://github.com/mateuszk098/kaggle_notebooks/tree/master/tyre_quality_classification) - _This notebook aims to handle a simple task of Computer Vision, i.e. binary classification of images, based on tyre quality images. The dataset description is as follows. The dataset contains 1854 digital tyre images, categorized into two classes: defective and good condition. Each image is in a digital format and represents a single tyre. The images are labelled based on their condition, i.e., whether the tyre is defective or in good condition.</br>
This dataset can be used for various machine learning and computer vision applications, such as image classification and object detection. Researchers and practitioners in transportation, the automotive industry, and quality control can use this dataset to train and test their models to identify the condition of tyres from digital images. The dataset provides a valuable resource to develop and evaluate the performance of algorithms for the automatic detection of defective tyres.</br>
The dataset may also help improve the tyre industry's quality control process and reduce the chances of accidents due to faulty tyres. The availability of this dataset can facilitate the development of more accurate and efficient inspection systems for tyre production._</br>
